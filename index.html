    <pre><strong>KGF: Chapter 2</strong> is a <em>2022</em> Indian Kannada-language period action film[20] written and directed by Prashanth Neel, and produced by Vijay Kiragandur under his Hombale Films banner. It serves as the direct sequel to

Produced on a budget of ₹100 crore, KGF: Chapter 2 was at the time of release the most expensive Kannada film ever made. Neel retained the technicians from its predecessor with Bhuvan Gowda handling the 
cinematography and Ravi Basrur composed the film score and songs. Dutt and Tandon joined the cast in early 2019, marking the former's Kannada film debut. Portions of the film were shot simultaneously with 
Chapter 1. Principal photography for the rest of the sequences commenced in March 2019, but was halted in March 2020 owing to the COVID-19 lockdown in India. Filming resumed five months later in August 2020 and 
was completed in December 2020. Locations included Bangalore, Hyderabad, Mysore and Kolar.</pre><!--i tag not use,em is not for itali size ,it is help for dont have proper eyesight and screen reader--><!--preformatted tag is ,space is preserved-->
